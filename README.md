# Project: Library
### [Live Link ðŸ‘ˆ](https://waldorfio.github.io/library/)
An interactive book library app where you can neatly store and track your books in a neat little environment. 
Built using vanilla JavaScript ES6, CSS3, and HTML5. 

Goal:
- To practice using constructors and classes in an applicable scenario
- To create a functioning, well-styled, app useable in a real scenario

Challenges Faced:
- Correctly passing form inputs into constructor object
- Factoring code into objects, as opposed consecutive variable declarations
- Storing book data to reference later
- Making effective use of the 'this' and 'bind' parameters, in the correct context
