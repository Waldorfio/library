# Project: Library
An interactive library built using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
Built to practice javascript object fundaementals, namely constructor and prototype use in a real scenario.

Challenges Faced:
- Correctly passing form inputs.
- Factoring code into objects, as opposed to messy consecutive variable declarations
