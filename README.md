# Project: Library
An interactive library built using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Goal:
- To practice using constructors and classes in an applicable scenario
- To create a functioning, well-styled, app useable in a real scenario

Challenges Faced:
- Correctly passing form inputs into constructor object
- Factoring code into objects, as opposed consecutive variable declarations
- Storing book data to reference later
- Making effective use of the 'this' and 'bind' parameters, in the correct context
