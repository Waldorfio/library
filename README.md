# Project: Library
An interactive library built using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
Built to practice javascript object fundaementals, namely constructor and prototype use in a real scenario.

Challenges Faced:
- Correctly passing form inputs
- Factoring code into objects, as opposed consecutive variable declarations
- Storing book data to reference later
- Making effective use of the 'this' and 'bind' parameters, in the correct context
